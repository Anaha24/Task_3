# Task_3
SQL for Data Analysis
Objective: Use SQL queries to extract and analyze data from a database.
SQL allows efficient data retrieval and manipulation using commands like `SELECT`, `WHERE` for filtering, `ORDER BY` for sorting, and `GROUP BY` for aggregating data. Joins (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`) enable combining data from multiple tables, while subqueries help retrieve filtered results within queries. Aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, and `MIN` summarize data effectively. Creating `VIEW`s helps store reusable queries as virtual tables for analysis. Optimizing queries with indexes improves performance by speeding up searches, especially on large datasets.
